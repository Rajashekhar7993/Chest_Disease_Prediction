This project focuses on predicting chest-related diseases using machine learning techniques. The system analyzes medical data (such as chest X-ray images or clinical features) to automatically identify the presence of chest diseases. The goal is to assist in early detection and diagnosis, helping healthcare professionals make faster and more accurate decisions.

The project involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction using Python. It demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in the healthcare domain.
